# TextEditorProject
Making a text editor by using JavaFX.

# Problems Now
For some reason, after saving a text file with notepad++, my editor isn't able to read it correctly.

# To run
In the shell of your choice, after changing directory where the program resides, type in the following:
```
javac NeedsPeerReview.java
java NeedsPeerReview
```

# Is it done?
It's not. The codebase is monolithic, and it's better to drop it, and start it again if I want to continue.
